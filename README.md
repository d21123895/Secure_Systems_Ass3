5. Open VSCODE and go to blockchain.py file inside the core directory and run it. If you get any error related to config file then try to run it in debug mode. Click on run -> Start debugging. You don't have to set the breakpoint. Sometimes config.ini does not work in batch mode. Keep that in mind.
